      "For this wine, a great dish to complement it would be grilled ribeye steak with a rosemary garlic butter sauce. The rich, full-bodied flavors of the wine will enhance the savory, juicy steak, while the rosemary garlic butter adds an aromatic touch that pairs beautifully with the wine's dark fruit and oak notes.",
